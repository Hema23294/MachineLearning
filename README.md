Drug Analysis:
A dataset containing a set of health conditions with drug administered has been used.
Purpose of this analysis is to predict which Drug has been most effective for a particular health condition based on various factors.
This prediction would help future patients to get the most effective treatment at the earliest.

Cyber Security Intrusion Prediction (Botnet Attack)

Introduction and Purpose:
We want to build a model that can accurately predict if the transmission is benign or if it has any malicious interuption.
I have used multiple machine learning algorithms to pick the best possible model that gives the most accurate result.

Algorithms Used:
Logistic Regression
KNN Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Multi-layer Perceptron(MLP) Classifier
